(766, 28, 'Berries are its weapons as well as the staple of its diet. The one that can throw a berry the farthest is the boss of the troop.'),
(767, 25, 'This Pokémon is a coward. As it desperately dashes off, the flailing of its many legs leaves a sparkling clean path in its wake.'),
(767, 26, 'Its habitat varies from beaches to seabeds. A natural scavenger, it will gleefully chow down on anything edible, no matter how rotten.'),

(770, 25, 'Possessed people controlled by this Pokémon transformed its sand mound into a castle. As it evolved, its power to curse grew ever stronger.'),
(770, 26, 'Buried beneath the castle are masses of dried-up bones from those whose vitality it has drained.'),
(770, 27, 'Each of its grains of sand has its own will. Palossand eats small Pokémon and siphons away their vital essence while they''re still alive.'),
(770, 28, 'Once it has whipped up a sandstorm to halt its opponents in their tracks, this terrifying Pokémon snatches away their vitality.'),
(771, 25, 'It lives in shallow seas, such as areas near a beach. It can eject its internal organs, which it uses to engulf its prey or battle enemies.'),

(771, 27, 'The tradition known as Pyukumuku chucking started from the custom of throwing Pyukumuku back into the sea after they wash onshore.'),

(772, 27, 'A Pokémon weapon developed for a specific mission, it went berserk during an experiment, so it was cryogenically frozen.'),
(772, 28, 'There''s danger of its going on a rampage, so its true power is sealed away beneath its control mask.'),
(773, 25, 'Its trust in its partner is what awakens it. This Pokémon is capable of changing its type, a flexibility that is well displayed in battle.'),
(773, 26, 'Although its name was Type: Null at first, the boy who evolved it into this formgave it the name by which it is now known.'),
(773, 27, 'This is its form once it has awakened and evolved. Freed from its heavy mask, its speed is greatly increased.'),

(776, 26, 'It gushes fire and poisonous gases from its nostrils. Its dung is an explosive substance and can be put to various uses.'),
(776, 27, 'It lives in volcanoes and eats sulfur and other minerals. Materials from the food it eats form the basis of its explosive shell.'),
(776, 28, 'Its exploding shell poses a real danger but is sensitive to moisture. On rainy days, Turtonator takes silent refuge in caves.'),
